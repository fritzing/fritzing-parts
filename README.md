This repository contains all part definitions that are shipped with the [fritzing app](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app). Every fritzing installation contains a clone of this repository and is continuously updated through github, so take great care when making changes.

Parts are composed of meta-data (.fzp) and related graphics (.svg). Read more on the [part folder structure and file format](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki/2.1-Part-file-format).

## Contributing parts

See the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-parts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute directly to this repository. If this seems too complex, you may alternatively share your part in the [fritzing forum](http://forum.fritzing.org/c/parts-submit).

### Pull Requests

Because a master-pull request results in a parts-update for all fritzing users, there is a nightly-parts branch. This branch is for testing and quality management. Please commit your pull-requests to this branch, so the master branch is clean and ready to use for all fritzing users. The nightly-parts branch gets merged from time to time after the QA is done.
