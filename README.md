This repository contains all part definitions that are shipped with the [fritzing app](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app). Every fritzing installation contains a clone of this repository and is continuously updated through github, so take great care when making changes.

Parts are composed of meta-data (.fzp) and related graphics (.svg). Read more on the [part folder structure and file format](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki/2.1-Part-file-format).

## Contributing parts

See the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-parts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute directly to this repository. If this seems too complex, you may alternatively share your part in the [fritzing forum](http://forum.fritzing.org/c/parts-submit).

### Pull Requests

Because a master-pull request results in a parts-update for all fritzing users, there is a develop branch. This branch is for new parts, testing and quality management. Please commit your pull-requests to this branch, so the master branch is clean and ready to use for all fritzing users. The develop branch gets merged from time to time after the QA is done.
